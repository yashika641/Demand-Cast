 # 📈 DemandCast – AI-Based Demand Forecasting for E-commerce Products

## 📌 Domain
- Retail & E-commerce  
- Time Series Forecasting  
- Machine Learning  
- Supply Chain Analytics  
- Social Media Intelligence  

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
DemandCast is an intelligent forecasting system that predicts **future product demand** by combining:
- **Historical sales trends**
- **Seasonality patterns**
- **External influence signals** such as social media sentiment, festive effects, and marketing campaigns  

The goal is to support **inventory planning**, **marketing strategies**, and **dynamic pricing** in e-commerce.

---

## 🧠 Core Objectives
1. Forecast product demand at SKU or category level (daily or weekly).  
2. Model time series patterns: trends, seasonality, and lags.  
3. Integrate external signals:
   - Google Trends data
   - Twitter sentiment
   - Promotional campaign periods
   - Festival/holiday calendar  
4. Compare and evaluate models: **ARIMA, FB Prophet, LSTM, XGBoost**.  
5. Build an **interactive dashboard** for input/upload and forecast visualization.

## 🛠 Key Features

### 📊 1. Demand Prediction Engine
- Uses time series models: **ARIMA**, **Facebook Prophet**, **LSTM**.  
- Trained on historical product-level sales data.

### 💬 2. Social Sentiment Integration
- Collects Twitter posts / reviews about products or brands.  
- Applies **VADER / BERT sentiment analysis** to track public opinion.  
- Sentiment scores are added as **external regressors**.

### 📅 3. Campaign & Seasonality Adjustments
- Tags dates with promotions, festivals, and mega sales.  
- Models promotional impact with binary indicators or weights.

### 📈 4. Dashboard for Business Teams
- Built with **Streamlit**.  
- Allows file upload and displays:
  - Forecasted demand
  - Confidence intervals
  - Sentiment trends
  - Historical vs predicted plots

### 🧪 5. Model Comparison & Tuning
- Train and compare:
  - Prophet (with regressors)
  - XGBoost with lag features
  - LSTM with time & text inputs  
- Evaluate using **RMSE, MAE, MAPE**.
